## About nystudio107/plugindev

This is a project scaffolding package for Craft 3 CMS plugin development.

Read the [A Craft CMS Plugin Local Development Environment article](https://nystudio107.com/blog/a-craft-cms-plugin-local-development-environment) for full details on this project.

It gives you the following out of the box:

* Craft CMS `^3.6.7` is installed
* `craftcms/redactor` plugin is installed
* `craftcms/commerce` plugin is installed
* A PHP 8.x environment with Imagick and other needed extensions pre-installed
* A prefab database seed for both MySQL and Postgres databases
* The ability to switch between MySQL and Postgres easily
* Dual [production/debug Docker](https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-annotated-docker-config-for-frontend-web-development#xdebug-performance) containers for PHP, for improved performance while also supporting XDebug
* Multiple sites for testing
* Prefab content with a "blog" channel for testing

## Using nystudio107/plugindev

This project package works exactly the way Pixel & Tonic's [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package works; you create a new project by first creating & installing the project:

    composer create-project nystudio107/plugindev --no-install --remove-vcs

This will create a project named `plugindev` which is a turnkey Craft CMS install for developing plugins.

We use `--no-install` so that the composer packages for the root project are not installed.

## Setting Up Local Dev

You'll need Docker desktop for your platform installed to run the project in local development

* Composer will have already created a `.env` file in the `cms/` directory, based off of the provided `example.env`
  
* Edit the `cms/composer.json` file and change the line `"url": "/Users/andrew/webdev/craft/*",` in `repostories` to point to your local plugin Git repositories
* Edit the `docker-composer.yaml` file and change the line `- /Users/andrew/webdev/craft:/Users/andrew/webdev/craft` to point to your local plugin Git repositories
* Start up the site with `make dev` (the first build will be somewhat lengthy)
* Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the site

### Login

The default login is:

**User:** `admin` \
**Password:** `password`

### Updating

To update to the latest Composer packages (as constrained by the `cms/composer.json` semvers), do:
```
make update
```

To start from scratch by removing `cms/vendor/`, then update to the latest Composer packages (as constrained by the `cms/composer.json` semvers), do:
```
make update-clean
```

### Switching between MySQL & Postgres

The plugindev project supports both MySQL and Postgres out of the box. It spins up a container for each database, and seeds them with a starter db.

To use MySQL (the default) just type:
```bash
make mysql
```

To use Postgres just type:
```bash
make postgres
```

...and then just reload the page.

This is great for ensuring your db queries work properly on both MySQL and Postgres, without having to set up two separate environments.

### Dual PHP Containers for Xdebug

By default, all of your requests will be routed through the production PHP container, for speedy local development and testing.

However, there is a second Xdebug PHP container that's always running too, for the time that you need to use Xdebug on the really tough problems.

What happens is a request comes in, Nginx looks to see if there's an `XDEBUG_SESSION` cookie set. If there's no cookie, it routes the request to the regular php container.

If however the `XDEBUG_SESSION` cookie is set (with any value), it routes the request to the php_xdebug container.

You can set this cookie with a [browser extension, your IDE](https://xdebug.org/docs/step_debug), or via a number of other methods. Here is the Xdebug Helper browser extension for your favorite browsers: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/xdebug-helper-for-firefox/) - [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/safari-xdebug-toggle/id1437227804?mt=12)

You can read more about it in the Dual [An Annotated Docker Config for Frontend Web Development](https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-annotated-docker-config-for-frontend-web-development#xdebug-performance) article.

### Makefile Project Commands

This project uses Docker to shrink-wrap the devops it needs to run around the project.

To make using it easier, we're using a Makefile and the built-in `make` utility to create local aliases. You can run the following from terminal in the project directory:

- `make dev` - starts up the local dev server listening on `http://localhost:8000/`
- `make clean` - shuts down the Docker containers, removes any mounted volumes (including the database), and then rebuilds the containers from scratch
- `make mysql` - switches the project to use the MySQL database container; just reload the browser
- `make postgres` - switches the project to use the Postgres database container; just reload the browser
- `make update` - causes the project to update to the latest Composer dependencies
- `make update-clean` - completely removes `node_modules/` & `vendor/`, then causes the project to update to the latest Composer dependencies
- `make composer xxx` - runs the `composer` command passed in, e.g. `make composer install` in the php container
- `make craft xxx` - runs the `craft` [console command](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/console-commands.html) passed in, e.g. `make craft project-config/apply` in the php container
- `make shell` - opens a shell in the PHP container

### XDebug with VScode

To use Xdebug with VSCode install the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug ) and use the following configuration in your `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9003,
            "log": true,
            "externalConsole": false,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/project/cms": "${workspaceRoot}/cms"
            },
            "ignore": ["**/vendor/**/*.php"]
        }
    ]
}
```
